## General info
<details>
<summary>Click here to see general information about <b>Distance Checker</b>!</summary>
<b>Distance Checker</b>. The Distance Checker is a program used to check the minimum distance to the edge of connections.
The program takes into account the type of bolts, the thickness of the plate in the connection, and verifies if there is enough space to mount it on-site.
This is the first script written, so there are no tests, and it is not divided into modules.
In the further learning process, it will be rewritten using Django and made into a web application. <br/>
